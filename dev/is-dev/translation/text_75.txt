"Intolerable traffic jams at Ölfusá Bridge" says Árborg's Municipal Council President
Árborg's Municipal Council President, Helgi S. Haraldsson, calls the daily traffic jams by Ölfusá Bridge in Selfoss completely intolerable.
He hopes that an invitation to tender for a new bridge across Ölfusá will take place this autumn.
As Icelanders embark on travels across their country, with heavy traffic on the country's highways, a traffic jam is created by the Ölfus Bridge every day as drivers try to reach Selfoss or drive through the municipality.
Long lines are created by the bridge and waiting in line can test the patience of drivers.
"Yes, it's completely intolerable. This is one big traffic jam here, and not only on Fridays because now it's also on working days.
There are long lines, sometimes extending to Hellisheiði, for those who want to pass through here on their way to the east of the country and those who are heading west, so it's obvious that we need a new bridge, preferably no later than yesterday," says Árborg's Municipal Council President, Helgi S. Haraldsson.
Helgi says that municipal authorities in Árborg recently had a very positive meeting with the head of the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration and one of its designers. 
"I think it's safe to say that there is more reason to be optimistic about work being done on this than ever before, because there's really something being done, and we should see a tender invitation for a new bridge next autumn."
But has Helgi any advice to the drivers stuck in the line at Ölfusá Bridge every day of the summer?
"Yes, you can drive across Þrengsli and through Eyrarbakki to be quicker, but those who are heading east cannot be told to cross Lyngdalsheiði, while those who are heading upcountry should use Mosfellsheiði, Þingvellir and Lyngdalsheiði."
Árborg's Municipal Council President, Helgi S. Haraldsson, who calls the traffic jams at Ölfusá Bridge outside Selfoss intolerable.
There are long lines at Ölfusá Bridge every day, with drivers often having to wait for some time before crossing the bridge.
In that case, the only thing to do is to draw a deep breath and think positive thoughts.
