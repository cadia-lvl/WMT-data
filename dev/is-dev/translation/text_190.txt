Over forty arrests in Seattle
Widespread protests were held yesterday against systemic racism and the President's decision to send FBI troops to cities to quell riots.
More than forty protesters were arrested in Seattle.
Seattle police used stun grenades and pepper spray in yesterday's large protest, which the police has now described as a riot.
21 police officers were injured and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months have passed since a wave of protests against systemic racism began in the United States, following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police.
The protest was held as a show of solidarity with Portland protesters.
There have been repeated violent conflicts between police and protesters since the President deployed federal troops in unmarked cars there, against the wishes of local authorities.
Thousands gathered in Portland over the weekend, and the police used tear gas and rubber bullets when conflicts arose between them and protesters.
