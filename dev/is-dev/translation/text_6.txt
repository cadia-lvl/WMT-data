Has taken 5 trips around the country this summer
Photographer and content creator Jón Ragnar Jónsson, who is often referred to as Jon From Iceland, has mostly been travelling around Iceland since the onset of the pandemic.
Jón completed his undergraduate studies in business administration at Reykjavik University several years ago and now makes a living travelling and producing marketing material for individuals and companies.
The summer began early for Jón, or in early April, when he travelled across the entire Westfjords, sleeping in his car.
He has already made five or six trips around the country this year.
He has also gone on countless day trips to various destinations.
Which trip stands out?
"It is difficult to name a favourite place for someone like me, who is constantly travelling and has seen everything.
The most important things are the weather and the company.
I've recently travelled a lot to the highlands, after the roads there were opened in June.
These trips are always highlights because it's such an adventure to reach your destination.
The last trip there, when 25 of us travelled in 5 large trucks to Fljótshlíð and from there to Álftavatn, may be my favourite trip of the year."
What are your plans for the summer?
"There are many exciting things ahead. I just completed a diving course with DIVE so now there'll be diving trips all over Iceland.
I also added a surfboard to my "toy box" so I'll spend more time in the sea than before.
Then I'm planning a 10-day "solo" trip with everything I need on my back, but it will become clear what my destination will be later this summer.
Anyway, I will mainly stay in the highlands in the near future since you can't explore that area year-round.
What place in Iceland is your favourite?
"I always find it difficult to pick one place, but Jökulsárlón has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.
The family went to a summer cottage by the roots of Breiðamerkurjökull and I've always felt good in this area since then.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there more than a 100 times."
Which place in Iceland would you encourage people to visit?
"I'm going to name one jewel from each part of the country, these being: Múlagljúfur in South Iceland, Stuðlagil in East Iceland, Aldeyjarfoss in North Iceland, Rauðasandur in the Westfjords, Snæfellsjökull in West Iceland, and last but not least... Mælifell in the highlands."
What's essential when you're travelling?
"I don't leave the city unless I have the following in my car: A good flashlight, hammock, wool sweater, hunting knife, fire logs, cooling box and Æði chocolate... those who know me know what I'm talking about."
