Biden ahead in polls in three key states
Only 100 days before the election, Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has a lead in three important swing states.
According to CNN today, Biden is ahead in Florida, Arizona and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is measured at 51% compared to 46% support for the President.
In Arizona, the numbers are 49%-45% for Biden, and Michigan is heading for a major Biden victory, as he has a 12 percent lead there, 52%-40%.
In order to win the election in November, in 100 days, Trump has to turn all these states and must in fact do more than that.
These days, Trump has to deal with a coronavirus pandemic for which more and more Americans blame him, with the vast majority of people polled saying that the federal government responded poorly or very poorly at the start of the pandemic.
In addition, Trump has fared extremely poorly in relation to the protests and riots following George Floyd's death.
Trump and his government are believed to have responded poorly or incorrectly to these issues.
Yet another addition to Trump's problems is the serious criticism he now faces for ordering federal troops to quell protests in cities where the mayor or governor is a Democrat.
This has created enormous hostility among the residents of these cities, and this anger has spread to Americans elsewhere.
Nor have photographs of federal agents pulling protesters into unmarked cars helped the cause of the United States.
The Lincoln Project's advertisement, which can be seen below, highlighted this.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with a very narrow margin of votes.
In fact, Trump won many states with a narrow margin and won the elections with a minority of votes.
He won Michigan, for example, with only 10,704 votes.
That is less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all polls taken seriously by political analysts show the same results: Biden has taken the lead.
CNN's new poll in Arizona, for example, shows that Biden's lead is now greater than the poll's margin of error.
The same can be said of Florida, according to polls from CNN and Quinnipiac University.
Even Fox News, which leans far to the right and endorsed Trump in 2016, have published similar polls in their media outlets.
The President's last hope according to the polls is for Trump to regain support in important swing state areas if the campaign focus turns to the economy.
The US economy took a heavy hit following the Covid-19 pandemic, but voters don't seem to be linking the economic crisis with the coronavirus pandemic.
In other words, a vast majority of voters seems to blame Trump for responding poorly to the coronavirus pandemic but still trust him better to deal with the country's current economic crisis.
However, Trump has had difficulty directing the campaign discourse.
Following the practically continuous riots since reports surfaced of the horrific video showing four policemen killing George Floyd, Trump attempted to focus on policing and its importance.
Law and Order became his motto.
This seems to have failed completely, as has been noted.
As polls show Trump at an increasing disadvantage, it becomes more likely that more and more Republicans will abandon Trump and declare their support for either Biden or someone else, which means supporting Biden without naming him specifically.
They do this because of the American practice of voting in several elections on the same ballot.
That way, a voter can simply check one party in the presidential part of the ballot and make that count as a vote for all other candidates from that party on the ballot.
Thus, Republican candidates for other offices attempt to distance themselves from Trump's poor results and enjoy individual election success.
