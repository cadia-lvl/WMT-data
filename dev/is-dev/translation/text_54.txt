Massive flooding expected due to Hanna
Hurricane Hanna, the first Atlantic hurricane of this year, reached the Texas shore last night.
Although Hanna soon lost power and turned into a storm, there has been heavy rain in the area and extensive flooding is expected.
Up to 30 centimetres of rain is expected to fall in a single day, with up to 46 centimetres in some places, according to the Associated Press.
The flash floods that may occur due to the rain are expected to be particularly dangerous.
The area where Hanna came ashore has been suffering because of the wide spread of the novel coronavirus there.
The sea also flooded the land, causing damage.
At least 43,700 people are now without electricity and evacuation shelters have been opened in the area.
President Donald Trump tweeted about the hurricane last night, saying that it was important for people to listen to experts and follow instructions.
