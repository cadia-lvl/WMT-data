Prince Joachim still in hospital
Prince Joachim has been hospitalised at the Toulouse University Hospital in France and his condition is stable.
The Prince underwent brain surgery yesterday after a blood clot had been discovered. 
"Prince Joachim's condition is still stable.
Fortunately, the Prince received professional care in time and is feeling reasonably well.
It is too early to say at this time how long he'll stay at the hospital," says Lene Balleby, the Danish Crown's press officer in a written response to Danish State Radio.
It's been only a few days since the Royal Family celebrated the 18th birthday of Felix, Joachim's second oldest son.
The birthday was celebrated at the Queen's vineyard, Château de Cayx in Cahors in the South of France.
The family was still holidaying there when Joachim was admitted to hospital yesterday.
Last year, 51 year old Joachim moved to France, where he studies at the Ecolé Militaire military academy, the first Dane to do so.
He also works as a defence specialist at the Danish embassy in Paris.
The Prince has strong ties to France, both his later father, Prince Henri and his wife, Princess Marie, being French.
