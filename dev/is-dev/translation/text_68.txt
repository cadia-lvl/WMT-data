Paw Patrol not at risk despite White House comments
The producers of Paw Patrol reaffirmed yesterday that there were no immediate plans to cancel the children's series.
The statement was made in response to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany's comments that the series, whose protagonists include police dogs, was a victim of cancel culture.
The series' Canadian producers were quick to react to McEny's words by saying that the fans need not worry about Paw Patrol's future.
Recently, a number of television series dealing with police work have been cancelled in the United States, following the wave of protests against police brutality.
Paw Patrol is not one of them, however, despite rumours to the contrary on social media.
In the White House press briefing on Friday, McEnany stated that President Trump was opposed to cancel culture, especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to situations where the comments or actions of individuals or corporations spark a harsh reaction on social media, with calls for the party in question to be boycotted as a sign of protest.
"We saw a few weeks ago that Paw Patrol, a children's show about cops, was cancelled.
The same goes for the shows Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
She added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego had halted the sales of their police sets, but that statement has no basis in fact, according to Lego spokesmen.
Reality series Cops and Live PD were recently cancelled in the United States, however.
Both series have been criticised for showing actual police footage without obtaining permission from the people shown.
