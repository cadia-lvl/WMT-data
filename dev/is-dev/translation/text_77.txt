The US Ambassador wants an armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, US Ambassador to Iceland, believes that his life is under threat here and wants to carry arms.
In early 2020, the US Embassy advertised repeatedly for bodyguards in Icelandic newspapers and in fact used the English word "bodyguard" in the advertisement.
According to Kveikur's sources, the main reason for these jobs being advertised is ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter's belief that his life is under threat in Iceland.
Kveikur has spoken to sources in Iceland and abroad who say that the ambassador is convinced that he's in grave danger because of his Jewish origin.
It's not as clear what the threat is, but those who Kveikur spoke with said that the threat of Islamic terrorists had been mentioned.
CBS Television published a report on the matter on its website this morning, quoting Washington sources who maintain that Gunter is paranoid, insisting on carrying arms himself, getting a stab-proof vest and having an armed security detail, as well as a bullet-proof car.
CBS sources claim that Gunter has been told repeatedly that there is no threat and the advertisement for a "bodyguard" was only to sooth Gunter.
According to Kveikur's sources, the positions had not been filled at the end of June while the application deadline was in February.
According to Kveikur's sources the US Embassy has not sent a formal request regarding these changes.
There has neither been a formal request for increased security nor for permission to have armed bodyguards outside the walls of the embassy.
That is explicitly prohibited by Icelandic law, except with a special authorisation from the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police.
Those who Kveikur spoke to within the administration say that there is no information on any kind of threat.
The National Commissioner's latest risk assessment is rather unambiguous when it comes to terrorist threat.
There are said to be no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no indications of terrorist or extremist groups being active here.
There are no grounds for allowing bodyguards employed by foreign embassies to carry arms in Icelandic streets, according to Kveikur's sources.
Gunter attracted considerable attention in Iceland when he retweeted the US President's tweet and referred to COVID-19 as the "China Virus".
The tweet was accompanied by a picture of the US and Icelandic flags.
