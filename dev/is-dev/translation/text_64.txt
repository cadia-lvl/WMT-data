The restaurant that most people don't know about but is considered one of the best
Not everyone is sure where the restaurant Bjargarsteinn is located, and it probably has more fans abroad than in Iceland, judging from the comments about it on TripAdvisor and other sites.
It should come as no surprise that there have been reports of people flying to Iceland with the express purpose of visiting it.
Food blogger and cookbook author Berglind Hreiðarsdóttir visited Bjargarsteinn recently and could hardly contain her enthusiasm.
"I don't know where to begin because the restaurant Bjargarsteinn in Grundarfjörður is simply a wonderful place.
The history of the house is the cutest I've heard, the food is top-notch, the view is great and the waiters are wonderfully entertaining," says Berglind. 
"Gunni, Bjargarsteinn's owner, produced one delicious dish after another for us.
My husband, me and our girls spent a whole evening eating, which should be an indication of how good the food was," Berglind adds.
"The building that houses the restaurant is an old residential house that was moved in one piece to Grundarfjörður.
The current owners saw the house for sale in Akranes, found a pretty seaside lot in Grundarfjörður and made their dream come true.
Bjargarsteinn's website contains more information on the history of the house."
"The household items and whole environment at Bjargarsteinn are unique.
Items from the whole family have been collected, which lend the premises a unique air.
There is a parlour on the second floor, and it's really cozy and homelike to come into this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and cooking expertise are obvious and much effort is clearly made to produce tasty and good-looking food," says Berglind and judging from the photos, every word is true.
