Megan Fox speaks up about the relationship
Megan Fox says that she found her twin soul in rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
"As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in astrology and I knew at once that this was my twin soul," says Fox, who is 34 years old.
"A twin soul is where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time," Fox explained.
"Thus we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him that as soon as we met.
I felt it at once."
"When we had known each other for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, where I told him about the astrological signs and asked him about his life.
I decided to go deep right away."
Machine Gun Kelly, who got to know her during the shooting of a film, concurs.
"I was beginning to hang outside her trailer in the hope of seeing her.
She has the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen."
Only two months have passed since Fox divorced her husband of ten years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
