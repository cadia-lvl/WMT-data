Together for 29 years - Occasional jealousy and suspicion
Family therapist Kristín Tómasdóttir answers questions from readers about family matters, children and love in DV's Family Corner.
This time, she responds to readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We don't know anything other than being together, and we feel fine, although we have both felt like we're missing out on something.
We have never been with any other people and have no comparison as to how things could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust about whether the other party is considering other options, thinking about an affair or even a divorce, or about moving on.
When we talk about this, we agree that we should tend to our relationship, but this is something that weighs constantly on us.
Do you have any advice?
Thanks for a great question, and I'm so happy that you have such honest communications that allow you to discuss your complex feelings about the relationship.
It would give me cause for concern if you were thinking this by yourselves, couldn't discuss it and might even take some steps that you would regret later.
Everything out in the open, isn't that always best?
A strong individual identity has the best predictive value for future happiness, so the stronger identity you have, the more likely you are to have a spouse with a strong identity.
The reason why teenage relationships don't last forever is usually that people grow apart, but when there is a synergistic effect, the individuals can create an unusually strong whole.
As the connection between you began to take shape in your formative years, it may be concluded that you have developed together and had a positive effect on each other's identity.
The fact is that we are shaped by our relationships.
The way I talk is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I display myself depends on the way you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn the question around and think: what do we have that others don't?
What do we gain from these years of uniqueness?
I think I can say with certainty that there may be considerably more advantages than drawbacks.
You have shaped each other for years so you might be said to be customised for each other, up to the millimetre.
That is more than many others can say.
Worth it?
You say that you feel you have missed out on something, but it is important to remember that big changes, such as divorce and a new relationship, also have side effects that you may not find too attractive.
You could be missing out on a fresh start, learning to be alone again, getting to know someone new and assembling a family.
This brings about new challenges, different kinds of problems and possibly something new and exciting.
But this is not only blue skies and happiness, oh no, at your age, this can be one heck of a complex project that may never click in the way that you already have with each other.
Is it worth it?
Wouldn't it be better to focus on what you can do to increase the excitement, unpredictability and novelty in your relationship?
You are not retired.
You can do so many things to make your long relationship even deeper.
What experiments can you do in connection with it?
What do you need from your spouse that you're not getting?
What can you give your spouse that you've never provided before?
You may have to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
There is considerably more tolerance today towards different relationship forms, and couples are beginning to define their relationship in various ways, e.g. an open relationship or polyamory, or deciding to break up temporarily.
I'm definitely not telling you what to do, as I'm no expert in what solutions would suit you, but it might lift this great weight off you to face the problem and think in solutions.
What do you need to make the distrust and fear go away?
You have been together for 29 years, which must mean that you're capable of doing various things together.
Use that as a strength and find your solution together.
