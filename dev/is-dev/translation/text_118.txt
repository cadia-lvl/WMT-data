An original solution by the Wolves - This is how they prevent injuries
Adama Traoré, winger with Premier League side Wolves, is an incredibly fast player.
His opponents have occasionally grabbed him to make sure that he didn't overtake them.
His shoulder has been dislocated several times because of this, but now the Wolves have found a solution to the problem.
The Sun reported on this.
In the Wolves' match against Crystal Palace, medics could be seen rubbing something on Traoré's shoulders.
"This is something that we had to do to protect Traoré," said a source within the Wolves camp — and the thing that was being rubbed on him was baby oil.
"Making him more slippery makes it more difficult for defenders to grab him and that way we can prevent further injuries."
Traoré's shoulder was first dislocated when Wolves played Tottenham in December.
Since then, his shoulder has been dislocated four times, the last time in a match against Sheffield United earlier this month.
