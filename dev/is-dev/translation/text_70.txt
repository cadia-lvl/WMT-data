The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
The US Ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, wishes to carry a gun in Iceland and wants increased security.
He is said to have been "paranoid" about his safety since coming here last year.
This is according to a report by CBS where it was also stated that this was Gunter's wish despite working in "one of the safest countries in the world."
Gunter is said to have asked the US State Department to request that Icelandic government allow him to carry a gun.
He has also asked for an armoured car and a vest to protect him from knife stabs.
CBS sources say that the Department has repeatedly informed Gunter that he is not in danger in Iceland.
According to the CBS report, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request concerning Gunter's potential carrying of arms had been received from the United States, as the government does not comment on the security arrangements of foreign diplomats.
However, the news agency's sources say that no request was submitted.
CBS also quotes its sources as saying that Gunter had been told not to make efforts to carry arms because that would be considered an insult in this country.
Gunter has no diplomatic experience but has worked for years as a dermatologist in California.
He is an active member of the Republican Party and an enthusiastic supporter of President Donald Trump.
His recent tweet about the "invisible China Virus" raised eyebrows in Iceland.
CBS sources also claim that Gunter has had a considerable negative effect on morale within the US Embassy in Reykjavík.
That he has already had seven Deputy Chiefs of Mission since May of last year.
He has accused them of being members of the so-called "Deep State", which is allegedly a network of American officials working to undermine Trump, and responded angrily when one carried snow into his office.
When the ambassador attended a conference in Washington DC last February, he refused to return for several months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter allegedly wanted to work remotely from California and Minister of State Mike Pompeo ultimately had to order him to return, which he did in May.
