Doctor ran 35 kilometres with face mask
British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 kilometres in a face mask to prove that oxygen levels are not reduced when face masks are worn.
Lawton is a doctor at the Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there during the pandemic.
To disprove the theory about oxygen levels and encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to and from work while wearing a mask.
Before he set off, he started a GoFundMe campaign in support of the Trussell Trust, which donates food in Bradford and other places around the UK.
"I'm a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been shocked by the falsehood that's been spread about face masks reducing people's oxygen levels," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in triathlon but that his endurance had been reduced during the pandemic.
He ran the 35 kilometres last Monday.
"The mask didn't come off at all (no food or drink) and oxygen levels were stubbornly 98% every time I checked," Lawton wrote on Twitter following his run.
