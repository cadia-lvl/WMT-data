Prepares to relocate more government agencies outside the capital area
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children intends to relocate more government agencies outside the capital area in the near future.
The Fire Prevention Department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be relocated to Sauðárkrókur next autumn, according to the Minister's decision, but experts within the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move to the north of the country.
This morning, Minister of Social Affairs and Children Ásmundur Einar Daðason stated in an interview with Sprengisandur on Bylgjan that it was important for rural areas that government agencies move there.
That this would bring about great value creation which would also create diversity.
"It's vital for the national economy, we're trying to develop everything all around the country.
Economic development, development that brings in currency, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry or some kind of utilisation of nature, and the nature of government jobs is such that they will provide great support for this development," says Ásmundur.
"More diversity and better support for the nation's resource utilisation and currency income will be created."
Ásmundur's decision to relocate the Fire Prevention Department of the Housing and Construction Authority has been harshly criticised by its employees and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Workers.
Six men who have expert knowledge of fire issues and work in the department all live in the capital area, and none of them intends to move to Sauðárkrókur.
"I think it's completely clear that there are differing political opinions on how vigorously this should be pursued.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should take drastic measures to distribute government jobs more evenly," says Ásmundur.
"We see that our neighbouring countries, Norway and Denmark, have been doing this successfully."
He says he is convinced that a vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of government agencies around the country.
"I think that there have to be more political decisions to relocate government jobs to rural areas, like I just did with the Housing and Construction Authority."
He takes the relocation of the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and the Unemployment Insurance Payment Office to Skagaströnd as examples.
"That is now a highly important workplace for the Skagaströnd community.
I think we should take further steps in this direction."
"I'm preparing further steps in this direction.
More relocations."
