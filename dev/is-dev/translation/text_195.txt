A torrent of goals in Breiðablik's first win in July
Breiðablik won its first league victory since 29 June when the team won ÍA, 5-3, in the Pepsi Max Men's League at Kópavogsvöllur tonight.
Meanwhile, ÍA lost its third league match in a row.
After winning their first three league games, Breiðablik went five matches without a win and had lost three matches in a row before the match against ÍA tonight.
So it was do or die for the Breiðablik team, which began the game with great energy.
Alexander Helgi Sigurðarson put the team ahead with a nice finish in the 11th minute after Kristinn Steindórsson had sent him through ÍA's defence.
Kristinn doubled the lead six minutes later after a particularly nice assist from the left wing by Gísli Eyjólfsson.
ÍA couldn't catch a break in the first half, as the home teams' relentless pressure made it enormously difficult for them to connect passes.
Breiðablik ruled the pitch completely and added their third goal in the 36th minute when Danish player Thomas Mikkelsen scored a header following Höskuldur Gunnlaugsson's corner.
Just three minutes later, Kristinn Steindórsson scored his second goal, the fourth for Breiðablik.
But the story of the first half did not end there.
ÍA gained a sliver of hope before the second half when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from a penalty just before half-time, following Kwima Quee's clumsy foul on Viktor Jónsson in Breiðablik's penalty area.
This meant that Breiðablik lead by 4-1 at half-time.
The second half was only three minutes old when ÍA scored again.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was alone and unguarded in Breiðablik's goal area and guided Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson's corner effortlessly into the net.
However, Hlynur committed a foul in ÍA's penalty area only three minutes later, when he fouled Alexander Helgi.
A penalty kick was awarded and Thomas Mikkelsen scored confidentially to give Breiðablik a 5-2 lead when only seven minutes of the second half had passed.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, ÍA scored again.
Breiðablik goal keeper Anton Ari Einarsson was under pressure from Viktor Jónsson and passed the ball to Viktor's foot, from where it bounced into the net.
The score was an incredible 5-3 less than ten minutes into the second half, after which the goal-scoring slowed down.
Despite good chances for more goals by both teams, including two very close ones from Breiðablik's Kwame Quee, no more were scored, making the results a 5-3 victory for Breiðablik.
With this, Breiðablik won its first match in almost a month, since 29 June. The victory puts the team in third place with 14 points, two points away from Valur in second place and three points away from KR in first place.
However, both KR and Valur have played one less match than Breiðablik.
ÍA must accept its third league loss in a row and now has ten points in eighth place, five points from being relegated.
