Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand Putin's resignation
Thousands of residents gathered in the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday to protest the arrest of the governor of the region of the same name in southern East Russia, and the appointment of his replacement, who has never lived in the region.
Former governor Sergei Furgal is very popular, and tens of thousands of city residents protested when he was detained and taken to Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered the murders of three businessmen fifteen years ago.
Last week, Furgal was formally removed as governor and replaced by his party colleague, 39 year old Mikhail Degtaryev, much to the displeasure of the locals.
Degtaryev is said to be inexperienced and, what's worse, without any connections to Khabarovsk, and the residents of the city called for his immediate resignation.
Degtaryev has completely ignored these calls.
There were almost as many protesters yesterday as in the first protest, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: The release of Furgal and the resignation of President Putin.
"We want the governor released because we believe he was most likely illegally detained," said Alina Sleopova, a protester in her mid-twenties, as quoted by AFP.
She insists that Kremlin agents had Furgal arrested "to protect their own interests rather than the interests of the region."
The Khabarovsk police allowed the protests to continue despite the protest march being a clear violation of the current ban on gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic.
On the other hand, Moscow police arrested at least 10 people who had gathered in Pushkin Square to support protesters in Khabarovsk, according to UK newspaper The Guardian.
Furgal's party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is a party of hardline nationalists and analysts consider it to be somewhat supportive of the Kremlin in most matters.
However, the same analysts told the BBC that Furgal's victory in the governor elections — which was clear and decisive — had been a considerable shock for Putin and United Russia, and an indication of the Kremlin's weakening hold on the eastern regions.
Furgal was arrested on 9 July and taken to Moscow where he awaits trial.
He is accused of having ordered three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two were carried out while the third failed.
According to the BBC's Moscow correspondent, Sarah Rainsford, supporters of Furgal, who enjoys great popularity at home, are convinced that the charge and arrest are politically motivated.
They want to know why the authorities didn't arrest him until now, Rainsford says, 15 years after his alleged crimes.
