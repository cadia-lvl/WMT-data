Volunteer arrested in connection with the Nantes fire
A volunteer at Nantes Cathedral in France has been arrested in connection with the fire that completely destroyed the church.
Le Monde quotes the prosecutor as saying that the suspect, a Rwandan refugee who worked as a caretaker in the church, had admitted to setting the fire.
The man's lawyer said to another media outlet that the man greatly regretted his actions.
Among the items lost to the fire was a 17th century organ and the church's historic stained glass windows.
The volunteer, who is 39 years old but has not been named, was arrested shortly after the fire on 18 July but then released from custody.
He was interrogated again yesterday and subsequently arrested.
