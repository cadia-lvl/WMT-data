Heavy rain and depression across the country on the bank holiday weekend
Judging from the reports of overfull hotels and campsites, at least in the south of the country, Icelanders have travelled extensively around the country this summer.
Travellers have also enjoyed exceptionally good weather, and DV's weather commentators all agree that the summer has been just splendid, at least up to this point.
But the Bank Holiday Weekend, which has traditionally been the biggest travel weekend of the year, draws closer.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, as it is now clear that events that have attracted large crowds in ordinary years will not be held.
The Westman Islands National Festival is just one example.
The weather will also play a large part, of course, and now it seems like there will be heavy rain all over the country, particularly in the south and southwest.
The Meteorological Office predicts heavy rain from Thursday evening until at least Saturday evening.
It should be noted that long-term forecasts have not always proven to be gospel truth here in the North Atlantic, and they could probably change.
Famed meteorologist Einar Sveinbjörnsson says in the forecast on his weather website, Blika, that a depression is expected on the Bank Holiday Weekend.
He says: Troughs in the upper atmosphere, with a corresponding cold that often extends down to the surface, cause a depression with wind and rain to form when the warmer air from the southwest attempts to enter.
Also of course warmer air that "blows" to the north.
Einar publishes a prognostic chart to support his forecast and says: "A small wave from America spreads to the east and with it, summer-warm air.
When it approaches, it manages to "flower" in the form of dropping air pressure and a considerable summer depression."
The big forecast models, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts to the left on the map and the American GFS forecast to the right are pretty much in agreement on this development.
According to the forecast, the front of the depression will pass on late Thursday and early Friday with a strong wind from the east and rain in most of the country.
A 985 hPa centre of low will then follow.
This time, somewhat warm air will follow in the north and east of the country on Saturday and even on Sunday as well.
However, there could also be wind along with this.
