Flew from Hornafjörður to Cape Town
The Eurasian collared dove, common wood pigeon, two-barred crossbill, black-throated loon and common crane are some of the birds that have strayed to Iceland this summer.
Fuglar.is, the website of the South East Iceland Birds Observatory, has almost daily brief reports of such rare birds, where they were spotted and sometimes their sex.
Iceland has many bird enthusiasts.
One sign of this interest is the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic Bird Species.
The group has around 14,600 members.
Members share photographs of birds and it is obvious that Iceland has plenty of good photographers who have the patience to photograph birds.
Brynjúlfur Brynjólfsson is one of them.
Binni, as he's called, is an employee of the South East Iceland Birds Observatory and the South East Iceland Nature Research Centre, and a close observer of bird life in the area.
He talks affectionately about these animals who enrich the Iceland fauna and have an important function, whether they be a big and powerful bird of prey or a tiny passerine bird.
The South East Iceland Birds Observatory was established in 2005, on the birthday of Hálfdán Björnsson from Kvísker in Öræfi, with the aim of continuing the important natural research carried out by him from 1940 onwards.
"Hálfdán was thirteen years old when he began gathering information on birds," says Brynjúlfur in a conversation with Kjarninn.
"We're not doing exactly the same things he did at the Observatory, but we're building on his data by counting and tagging birds."
Hálfdán was a farmer and amateur scientist, born on 14 March, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects and bird life.
He passed away shortly before his 90th birthday, on 10 February 2017.
Many of those who got to know Hálfdán and his siblings at Kvísker began to share their interest in Icelandic nature.
One of them is Björn Gísli Arason, the South East Iceland Birds Observatory's "other employee".
Björn grew up at Reynivellir in Suðursveit, where he received extensive education in nature from his neighbour, Hálfdán at Kvísker.
But what on earth does the South East Iceland Birds Observatory do?
Around 20 March of each year, the Observatory puts up special bird nets in Einarslundur, a grove close to Höfn í Hornafirði.
Birds caught in the nets are tagged with standard marks.
The nets are taken down around 10 May, at the start of nesting season.
The nets are up all day, from at least six in the morning and into the afternoon.
And they have to be checked once every hour.
The birds caught in them are tagged, measured and then released.
Once every hour, the reporter asks in amazement.
"Yes, we divide it between us, Bjössi and me.
As we also have to make a living, this can be quite a puzzle, but we somehow manage to tend to this," says Brynjólfur.
The nets are put up again between 1 August and 10 November — every day, weather permitting.
Between their turns watching the nets and during the times when they are not up, Brynjólfur and Jón are tagging arctic terns, great skuas and various moorland birds wherever they can catch them.
They also take on various special projects.
One of these projects is a collaboration with the Icelandic Institute of Natural History and involves collecting castor bean ticks from birds.
"The castor bean ticks jump on the birds in their winter location and then hitch a ride with them when they come here in spring.
This happens shortly before they set off so the ticks are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then they jump from the bird and try to find another host when they have to."
But enough about ticks.
When asked how the birds of South-East Iceland are doing this summer, Brynjúlfur replies that the arctic tern's egg-laying seems to be going well — where it lays eggs at all.
"The arctic tern's main nesting grounds are at Hali in Suðursveit, and everything is going well there.
There are no nesting grounds at Jökulsárlón anymore, however, where there were huge nesting grounds several years ago."
He says that a few years ago, more than a thousand arctic tern pairs laid eggs there, but now they can be counted on one hand.
"When we look at moorland birds and shorebirds, it seems like you find fewer of them in the last few years.
But of course there's always variation from one year to another."
Brynjúlfur thinks that this great shift is probably due to food supply.
"Everything revolves around food, of course."
He says that human activity could also have an effect on the survival of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to be doing rather well in South-East Iceland this summer.
"One positive thing I've found is that the number of arctic skuas is increasing again after a great lull," says Brynjólfur, "but meanwhile, the great skua has suffered terrible decline in the last years and decades."
As for passerine birds, it seems like the white wagtail should do well in its egg-laying this summer, like it did last year.
There are somewhat fewer redwings and meadow pipits, but Brynjúlfur says that it won't become clear until next autumn how the summer turned out for them.
But let's talk about the stray birds.
They often cause quite a bit of stir, particularly if they are very rare or perhaps colourful.
These two interesting factors apply to one of the summer's most popular strays: the common wood pigeon.
"But this summer has actually been relatively quiet when it comes to strays," says Brynjúlfur, but notes that a common crane can now be found in the area, and that common wood pigeons have been spotted and are beginning to nest here.
When Brynjúlfur and Björn come into contact with strays, they tag them just like other birds.
The tags are international and used all over the world.
Tagging can provide various information, e.g. about the birds' winter location, where they nest and their migration routes.
"You can even see how long they are in flight during migration," Brynjólfur points out.
This information is useful in many respects, for instance when it comes to epidemics such as bird flus.
"Our knowledge is constantly being expanded."
If someone abroad finds a bird tagged by the South East Iceland Birds Observatory, the information is sent to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.
"We have had recoveries all the way in Cape Town, South Africa.
An arctic tern that we had tagged was found there.
One of our arctic terns was later found in the United States."
One bird is particularly close to Brynjúlfur's heart: the great skua.
"The great skua is our bird," he says, pointing out that the South East Iceland Birds Observatory and the South East Iceland Nature Research Centre have the task of monitoring its survival status — which has become rather poor, placing it on the watch list.
It's hard to say with any certainty what caused the population drop but according to one theory, the great skua used to benefit from the catch thrown into the sea from fishing vessels, with a corresponding effect on the population now that the catch is utilised much more extensively.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
"You obviously can't get me to say no," says Brynjólfur with a laugh, adding: "We're also chasing strays so we have to go to more places."
But South-East Iceland is certainly unique when it comes to its bird life.
"This area is like a bottleneck where birds come into the country from Europe before dispersing.
It's very interesting to be here and observe migratory birds and strays but there are fewer nesting birds here than in many other parts of the country.
There isn't much distance between the shore and the glacier so the area as such is well suited for bird watching."
But does Brynjúlfur have a favourite bird?
He thinks for a little while before replying.
He finds the question difficult.
„The pied avocet is my bird, as I've found nine of the ten spotted in Iceland," he answers at last.
"Photographing the common snipe may be the most fun.
Then it's always good to find birds that have never or rarely been seen before in Iceland, not to mention finding a new species for Europe."
Both Binni and Bjössi have indeed done that.
You can look at Binni and Bjössi's work on Facebook and the website Fuglar.is to follow their work with the South East Iceland Birds Observatory more closely.
