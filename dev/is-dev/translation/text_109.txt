Aron Elís in a deciding match to qualify for Europe - Ísak substituted at half-time
Aron Elís Þrándarson will play a deciding match to qualify for Europe in the Danish Superliga.
Ísak Bergmann Jóhannesson only played the first half with top-seated Norrköping against the bottom team of Falkenberg in Sweden.
Aron Elís was a part of Danish club OB's squad when it reached the deciding match to qualify for the UEFA Europa League play-off round.
OB will face AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the deciding match, depending on which team will be ahead after the final round of the Superliga's top teams later today.
Aron Elís played the entire 1—1 match away against Horsens today, but OB won the previous match between the teams at home, 3–1, thereby winning the duel with a combined score of 4–2.
Ísak was part of Norrköping's starting lineup, which unexpectedly found itself down 2–0 at half-time against the bottom team of Falkenberg in the Allsvenskan.
Norrköping substituted three players at the start of the second half, and Ísak was one of those who had to go off.
Norrköping was able to equalise but Falkenberg scored in the 89th minute, making the score 3-2.
However, there was still time for Norrköping to equalise with a penalty at the last minute, 3–3.
Norrköping remains at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which has still a match to play.
The point was enough for Falkenberg to raise itself from the bottom seat for the time being, as it is now a point above Helsingborg and Kalmar, who have still a match to play.
