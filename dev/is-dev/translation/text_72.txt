Believes his security threatened in Iceland
"Despite being assigned to one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been "paranoid" about his security since coming to Reykjavik last year."
Thus begins CBS News' detailed coverage of the US Ambassador to Iceland, quoting numerous sources from within the United States foreign service.
The CBS report maintains that he wanted the State Department to obtain special permission from the Icelandic government for him to have a firearm.
He is also said to have requested an armoured car and entertained ideas of wearing a vest that could protect him from knife attacks.
The State Department declined to say if there is any credible threat to Gunter's safety, but according to U.S. government officials, the ambassador has been informed multiple times that he is at no extraordinary risk.
Regardless, the US Embassy in Iceland recently placed a jobs listing, including in Morgunblaðið on 18 July, looking for full-time bodyguards, but CBS sources say that this was done to placate Gunter's concerns.
The State Department does not comment on specific security measures for their embassies, but says that the goal is always to provide security by proactive means.
The State Department did not answer questions about Gunter's desire to arm himself and the Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs declines to confirm whether the U.S. officially sought permission for the ambassador to carry a firearm, adding that they generally do not comment on the security details of diplomatic missions.
However, CBS sources in Iceland said that such a request was never made, and three US officials claimed that Gunter was talked out of these plans as they could cause offence to Icelanders.
The CBS report also addresses the various problems around the US Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed last year, including the fact that he has already replaced seven Deputy Chiefs of Mission.
The first deputy is said to have prepared extensively, including learning Icelandic, only to be refused the post at the last minute because Gunter "didn't like the look of him" at their first meeting.
His successors haven't fared much better under Gunter's command.
Senior leadership at the State Department is reportedly aware of the situation at the US Embassy in Iceland, but has been reluctant to interfere in matters closely connected to the President.
In addition to all this, Gunter is said to be unwilling to follow various foreign service protocols and respect the chain of command.
In February, after attending a conference in Washington, Gunter allegedly refused to return to Iceland, leaving a temporary deputy in charge of his post for months, in the middle of a pandemic.
Gunter is even said to have requested to work remotely and stated that he would not return to Iceland unless specifically asked to do so by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
According to a statement from the State Department, Gunter had decided to go on personal leave after the conference and his return was further delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, but according to CBS sources, many within the Department had asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he didn't do so until May, when Pompeo contacted him and asked him to please return to the US Embassy in Iceland.
The CBS report also notes Gunter's unpopularity in Iceland, particularly in relation to a heavily criticised tweet where he referred to the coronavirus as "the invisible China Virus".
Gunter is one of many ambassadors with practically no diplomatic experience who have been appointed under President Donald Trump.
