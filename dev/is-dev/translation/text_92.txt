Sells the apartment where she has lived for 30 years
Actress Susan Sarandon has put her New York home up for sale.
Sarandon has lived in the apartment for 30 years and raised all her children there.
The building where the apartment is located is in Manhattan's Chelsea neighbourhood and was built before the First World War.
The asking price is USD 7.9 million, or more than one billion Icelandic Krona.
The apartment is just over 560 square metres and is on the 7th and 8th floors of the building.
Sarandon bought the house in 1991 with her ex-husband, Tim Robbins.
When they divorced in 2011, Sarandon kept the house.
Sarandon and Robbins had Jack and Miles together, and she previously had her daughter, Eva.
All three children grew up in the apartment.
It has six bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms.
The apartment is bright and pleasant with particularly beautiful interiors.
