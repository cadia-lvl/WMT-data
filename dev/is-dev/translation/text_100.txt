Believes it too early to declare another wave in this country
An expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department believes it's too early to declare another wave of the pandemic.
Three new domestic infections were diagnosed at the virology department of Landspítali hospital yesterday, and tens of people are in quarantine.
Two domestic infections were diagnosed on Thursday, one in a man in his twenties and another in a man in his teens.
These were the first diagnosed infections since the beginning of the month.
Three additional domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday, including one in someone who had been at the Rey Cup football tournament in Laugardalur.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, press officer for the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, told the news agency yesterday that fewer people had to be tested because of this infection than originally thought.
One infection is in an individual who entered the country from abroad on 15 July.
By then, the rules on the so-called return hygiene measures had entered into effect.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department, says that the individual in question followed the old procedure.
His test was negative upon his entry into the country, but he later became sick, has now been isolated, and six people have been quarantined.
They are all about to be tested and two have become symptomatic.
The third infection is connected to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday, and twelve people have been quarantined in connection with that.
It has come to light that this is a new variation of the coronavirus that has not been previously diagnosed in this country.
"We don't know exactly where this type of virus comes from, but we have not seen it before.
The one who is believed to have brought the virus into the country had been in Israel but also other European countries."
She believes it's too early to declare that the so-called second wave of the pandemic has begun in this country, like other European countries fear.
"While the majority is still traceable, it is not obvious that this is the case.
But we are vigilant and observant, and thinking of ways to respond if something like this would start up."
