Will consider laws on the independence of board members
The Prime Minister says it's not unnatural for pension funds to establish criteria on workers' rights in their investment policy.
The Central Bank Governor's comments on the need to ensure the independence of Board members of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken under consideration.
When Icelandair ceased negotiating with the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association and laid off all airline hostesses, the Board of VR declared that VR-appointed members of the Board of the Pension Fund of Commerce would boycott or vote against the pension fund's participation in Icelandair's upcoming stock offering.
VR Chairman Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson subsequently said that members of the Board would be replaced if they did not follow these instructions.
Ragnar withdrew this statement three days later, however, as did the Board of VR.
Central Bank Governor Ásgeir Jónsson said to RÚV News on Friday that the independence of pension fund Board members in the funds' decisions had to be ensured, possibly with a legal amendment.
Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir says that the independence of pension fund Board members is important but believes that it is already ensured by law.
"Now the Central Bank Governor, who is of course the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, under whose authority this is, says that the regulatory environment around this independence should be examined specifically, and we will of course take this under consideration if there is anything that has to be reviewed," she says.
Katrín says that according to law, pension funds should establish ethical criteria in their investment policy.
Such policies should preferably deal with the social and ethical criteria that they want to focus on in their investments.
"I would also not consider it unnatural for pension funds to establish criteria on workers' rights in their investment policy.
But I think it's natural for such decisions to be made through policy development rather than individual investment decisions," says Katrín.
