China gives Reykjanesbær 2,000 face masks to support the fight against Coronavirus
Last week, Chinese Ambassador Jin Zhijian delivered two thousand face masks to the mayor of Reykjanesbær.
This was done on the occasion of the mayor's visit to the Chinese embassy on 22 July.
Víkurfréttir first reported this.
The purpose of the mayor's visit was to reciprocate the Chinese ambassador's visit to Reykjanesbær, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
According to Víkurfréttir, they discussed strengthening the twin town relationship, established in 2014, between the municipalities of Reykjanesbær and Xianyang.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, can be traced to this twin town relationship, as city authorities in Xianyang wished to donate masks to support the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
Víkurfréttir's report states that the masks will be used in vulnerable institutions and establishment in Reykjanesbær, both for staff and visitors.
The accompanying photo shows the flags of Iceland and China and an inscription on the face mask box reading "Bare is back without brother behind it".
