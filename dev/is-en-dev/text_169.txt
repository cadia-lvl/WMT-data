Solskjær: The next step is winning something
Man Utd manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær was understandably very happy with the team securing a third-place position in the Premier League today.
This means that the team will play in the UEFA Champions League next season.
United needed a draw or win against Leicester today, and the result was a 2-0 victory for the Red Devils.
"Reaching third place was a great achievement for the players considering how the situation has been during the season.
I think that me and the boys may have overcome a mental block by winning such a big game, considering our two semi-final losses this season.
We knew that we needed good results today, and now we can begin our next chapter which for these boys means winning titles," added Solskjær, pleased with the victory.
Manchester United still has a chance to win a title this season, as the team plays in the Europa League in August and has practically secured a spot in the quarter-final.
