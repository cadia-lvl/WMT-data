GPS may be unsecure
Many countries are now developing position technology that's an alternative to the Global Positioning System, GPS.
An engineering lecturer says that there may be reason to be concerned about the security of the GPS, which is owned by the US Army.
The old LORAN system is undergoing a renaissance.
GPS technology follows us everywhere we go.
We use it when we fly, sail and drive, for surveying, in industry and for recreation.
Most people don't consider the fact that it is a military tool owned by the US Army, which didn't make it available for civilian use until the 1980s.
GPS technology uses coordinates from a satellite 20,000 kilometres above the ground, so natural conditions have little effect on it.
"But it's very easy to disrupt it.
And people with bad intentions can easily disrupt the reception of these signals," says Sæmundur E. Þorsteinsson, engineering lecturer at the University of Iceland and expert in risk management and telecommunication security.
He says that it's also easy to send a false signal with an incorrect location, in warfare for example.
"The GPS is owned by the US Department of Defense.
They have ensured the public that the system is available at all times.
But they could certainly turn it off if a highly eccentric President would get the idea to do such a thing, he could presumably do that," says Sæmundur.
Other nations have therefore begun to consider other systems and position technology.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is putting the location system Galileo into use.
"The Galileo system is mainly developed for civilian use.
It is perhaps slightly more accurate and is of course controlled by the European Union.
That means that it's controlled by many governments rather than a single government," says Sæmundur.
Many have also begun reconsidering the old LORAN technology.
It is based on radio waves and was in use from the 1950s and until it was replaced by GPS technology.
LORAN signals are transmitted through low frequency radio signals by land-based transmitters.
"It would be a new version of the LORAN system called eLoran, or Enhanced Loran, which is under serious consideration as a backup system in many countries because disrupting it requires using somewhat different principles; it's much more difficult than to disrupt a satellite system," says Sæmundur.
However, it's probably safest to have access to as many positioning systems as possible.
