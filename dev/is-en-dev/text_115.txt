Believes Icelandair to have been in a grey area when airline hostesses were laid off
The Minister of Social Affairs believes Icelandair to have been in a grey area when the company laid off all airline hostesses in the middle of a wage dispute.
He also says that he requested a review of the law forbidding firefighters to enter residential properties following the fire at Bræðraborgarstígur.
On 17 July, Icelandair decided to lay off all 38 airline hostesses employed by the company while the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association's wage dispute was still under consideration by the State Conciliation and Mediation Officer.
There were differing opinions about whether Icelandair's layoffs were legal and the case was expected to be resolved before the Labour Court.
That never happened, though, as the airline hostesses and Icelandair reached an agreement just over 24 hours after the layoffs.
However, Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason says that in his mind, Icelandair's decision was in a grey area and violated workers' rights.
"My opinion is that this is a certain right that is supposed to protect workers.
When you're negotiating and with the State Conciliation and Mediation Officer, this way should not be an option.
It's completely clear in my mind that this could not have been upheld.
I think it's completely clear, in my mind, that people had reached a grey area in that regard," says Ásmundur.
He would therefore not encourage other companies to go the same route as Icelandair.
"Now you also see dangerous talk of how normal it would be to reorganise this system to reduce this right, and I'm completely against that."
In Sprengisandur this morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the administration's response to the fire at Bræðraborgarstígur in late June, where three people died.
The Minister says that the investigation of the case is now in the hands of the Housing and Construction Authority, to which he has provided instructions.
"According to the current law, the fire brigade may not enter residential properties.
I have asked the Housing and Construction Authority to look specifically into whether there is reason to make any legal amendments.
I'm prepared to propose the necessary legal amendments to reduce the chance of something like this happening again," says Ásmundur Einar.
