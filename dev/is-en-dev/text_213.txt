A giant from Kristnipollur in Laxá in Dalir
The first 100 cm salmon in Laxá in Dalir was caught this afternoon.
The angler was Arnór Ísfjörð Guðmundsson.
He had caught an 89 cm long female in Kristnipollur.
Kristnipollur became available to him again in the afternoon, and he was reminded of a story he had heard about how the male often took the bait after the female had been caught.
With this in mind, he cast his fly, a Collie Dog, over Kristnipollur.
He soon detected a strike, and in his own words:
"In about five seconds, it cleared itself completely and I realised that it was a one-metre fish.
I was a little stressed out as I had an eleven-pound leader.
I usually pull hard on fish but I worked on this one for forty minutes.
In fact, he was rather easy to deal with.
He took a few trips up and down the hole before I managed to land it, which was a wonderful feeling.
I threw the rod away and jumped on it.
It measured at 102 cm and I measured it twice," said the happy angler when Sporðaköst caught up with him in the fishing lodge Þrándargil at Laxá í Dalir.
Actually, Arnór is no novice when it comes to 100 cm salmons.
This was his eighth.
He has caught such fish in Blanda, Svartá, Hraunsfjörður, Kjarrá, two in Langadalsá and one in Eystri Rangá.
Arnór says that fishing is good in Laxá in Dalir.
The group that finishes tomorrow has caught 35 salmon, eighteen of them caught by our man.
