Goblet sippy cups for babies
There are sippy cups for babies who want to make a toast with their parents, despite their young age, and use glasses that are better suited to finer dining.
Some parents will undoubtedly welcome this — the parents who are tired of childish sippy cups with colourful pictures.
But it's not least children who are interested in their parents' glasses, as their base and stem makes them look more exciting.
We saw these cups on the website modernhouseessentials.com, where many treasures can be found.
The cups come with a strong top and steady stem, and they are heat-resistant so the children can enjoy both hot and cold drinks.
Each cup holds approximately 150ml.
Those who want to take a closer look at the cups can visit the website HERE, where they are now on special offer, only ISK 3,400.
