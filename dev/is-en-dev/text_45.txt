Thomsen wants to leave KR - expects a salary cut
Tobias Thomsen will attempt to go home to Denmark and leave Icelandic champions KR next month, and says that he senses interest from members of the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and been Icelandic champion with both Valur and KR.
But now the 27-year old striker says that he's beginning to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefanía Jakobsdóttir.
The term of the Danish player's contract with KR is until the end of this season so it is clear that a Danish club would have to negotiate a transfer fee with KR to get him in August, before the next Danish season begins.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
"Yes, I know that the Danish leagues start again in late August.
Of course, that means that I would have to terminate my contract with KR, but I have told them that I miss Denmark and they have full understanding of that," said Thomsen in an interview with bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with manager Rúnar Kristinsson, who understood the situation completely, and Thomsen said that he did not believe that the transfer fee would be much of a problem.
"I also had discussions with two 1st Division teams when the league was winding down and the teams knew where they would end up.
There has already been some interest regarding the upcoming season, so I could very possibly go to Denmark before the Icelandic league is finished," said Thomsen, while adding that there weren't many Danish teams that could buy up his contract with KR.
"It's not completely clear now, but there has been interest.
I also have to find the best option for me and my girlfriend, who is Icelandic and will come with me.
It depends on several things," said Thomsen and added that he was mainly considering Copenhagen.
Thomsen said that KR did not have to worry about him not making a full effort in training sessions and matches although he misses Denmark.
"KR knows what it's getting from me, which is 100 percent in everything I do.
I can always disregard the fact that I miss Denmark when I'm training or playing matches," said Thomsen, adding that leaving the Icelandic champions to join Denmark's second highest league would obviously mean a cut in his salary.
"I would probably have to take a little salary cut because of the coronavirus crisis, which seems to have had a rather bigger effect on the Danish clubs than the Icelandic ones.
But I'm also a student and one solution could be for the club to provide me with a job.
Seeing that most 1st Division clubs have a sponsorship agreement.
I'm studying sports management through the players' association and finishing a BA degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only twice been a member of KR's starting lineup in the Pepsi Max League this season, but he has been involved in five matches and scored one goal.
Last season, he started 21 times for the team and scored seven goals.
KR is tied for points with Valur at the top of the Pepsi Max League but has yet to play its match against KA in Akureyri today.
