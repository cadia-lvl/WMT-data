Kanye apologises to Kim
American musician, fashion mogul and presidential candidate Kanye West has apologised to his wife, Kim Kardashian West, for his public comments on the family's private matters.
Yesterday evening, he tweeted "I would like to apologise to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter."
There has been much speculation on the status of their relationship as Kanye has expressed himself unreservedly on social media and held a rally on Monday where he talked about the birth of his daughter, North West, claiming that he almost killed her.
Kim came forward on Wednesday, posting a message to her Instagram followers where she discussed the health condition of her husband, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Until now, Kardashian West has refrained from discussing her husband's condition publicly, saying that she does so in consideration of their children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health.
