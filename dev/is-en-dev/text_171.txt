Saudi Arabia – beach resort of the future? No alcohol or bikinis
The tourism industry has grown enormously all over the world in recent years and now, Saudi Arabian authorities want their share of the pie.
They intend to spend the equivalent of ISK 60,000 billion to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reported this.
But this tourist paradise won't be in the style that Icelanders are accustomed to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available and women won't be permitted to sunbathe in bikinis.
But how can tourists be enticed to visit this strictly religious Islamic country?
The ways to do so includes building a new city with white beaches, a moon (man-made of course), drone taxis and robots to serve people.
The Guardian reports that Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is the one who wants to embark on this investment.
The money will of course come from the country's oil wealth.
The Crown Prince says that it's out of the question for women to avoid covering their shoulders and knees in public while admitting that it's not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in a country where it's too hot when the sun is high in the air and you can't rely on the wind chill.
But then it's also possible that the unability to buy alcohol might dampen the interest of potential tourists.
