Gathers sources on the National Festival in the age of Coronavirus
Anna Lilja Sigurðardóttir created the Facebook group "My National Festival 2020" to collect sources about the National Festival that inhabitants of the Westman Islands intend to hold in the coming weekend.
Many intend to put up a tent in their garden and party with friends and family.
Anna Lilja talked to Hvati in the programme Helgin on Bylgjan.
"Nothing has been posted yet, which is also very exciting because there are now 600 members in the group so people are obviously intending to do something," says Anna Lilja.
Some Westman Island residents are going to have a tent party in their garden.
"People have talked about having their own [festival], maybe put up a tent in their garden and gather the family together, like people always do at this time," says Anna.
"You expect people to spend time with their next of kin.
However, she says that it's likely that many simply won't be there "but still intend to hold a small national festival somewhere else."
The festival committee is now busy refunding the tickets that were bought, but Anna believes that many locals are more interested in securing tickets to next year's festival.
"People are even investing in tickets now to have them valid for 2021."
"I'm a great fan of the National Festival, love the preparation and everything about it, but sometimes something that you have no control over just enters your life and then that's just the way it is," says Anna (it's reportedly quite common for people to ask whether Westman Islands people can't skip the festival "just this once").
Anna Lilja says that she did not create the group for herself or encourage people to hold their own National Festival but rather to gather sources on this year's Bank Holiday Weekend celebrations in the Westman Islands.
"What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this for anything. There is a possibility for those who use sources like these for something, but I was just creating a venue for people to submit what they're doing."
The annual bonfire on Fjósaklettur has also been built.
"I think many people are excited to have a bonfire on Friday night.
Of course, the only problem is that the forecast is nothing special."
"This bonfire will be lit but it remains to be seen how it will be," says Anna Lilja.
