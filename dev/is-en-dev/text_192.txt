Earned himself another arrest
This morning, a man was arrested for the second time in a brief span of time when he refused to leave the police station after having been released from custody.
The man was arrested for drunk driving last night and detained in a holding cell overnight.
When he was released this morning, he refused to leave and came back several times, according to the police.
He did not follow the police's repeated orders to leave, so he "earned himself" an extension of his stay with the police, to quote the Reykjavík Metropolitan Police Diary.
