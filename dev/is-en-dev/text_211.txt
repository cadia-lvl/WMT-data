Houses burned, shops looted and infrastructure damaged
More than sixty are dead and sixty more injured after an attack in the village of Masteri in Sudan's Darfur region yesterday.
The attack "was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks where houses were burned, shops and markets looted and infrastructure damaged," according to a statement today from the UN Humanitarian Office in the capital of Khartoum.
Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan, has declared that security forces will be sent to the war-torn region to "protect the inhabitants and the crops."
Only two days ago, unknown troops killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack in the area.
"The escalation of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to increased displacement, compromising the agriculture and threatening people's lives and livelihood," according to the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur in West Sudan began in 2003 when rebels, most of whom are non-Arab, rose up against the Khartoum government.
Government troops and Arab mercenaries who attempted to quell the rebellion have been accused of widespread atrocities, with approximately 300,000 killed in the conflict, according to the United Nations' estimate.
Omas al-Bashir, who was deposed as leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, Sudan's new authorities are in peace negotiations with the main rebel groups.
