Haymaking going very well in South Iceland
Haymaking in South Iceland has gone unusually well this summer as the weather has been advantageous for farmers.
Most have cut their grass once, the second round has begun in many places and some are expected to be able to cut their grass for the third time in late summer.
The summer weather has been kind to South Iceland farmers, like other inhabitants of the region, and the growth of the grass in their fields does not make matters worse.
Haymaking has therefore gone well.
Sigurður Ágústsson, dairy farmer at Birtingarholt in Hrunamannahreppur and haymaking contractor, is pleased.
"Yes, this has been going very well, and I think the farmers must be optimistic; it's gone smoothly as the weather has been excellent for the last two weeks.
The hay is very good as the harvest is good and overall hay quality is fine," says Sigurður.
Sigurður says that more people, not least dairy farmers, have been using stacks or pits in haymaking with great success, although it's by far most common to use bales.
"It's lively, yes, yes. In fact, this has been very convenient for the past two or three weeks because the weather has been so nice and dry, making it easy to manage.
It makes all the difference, there's less stress and you can sometimes delay what could be done today until tomorrow so it's splendidly convenient.
But does Sigurður think that any farmers will cut the grass a third time?
"Yes, that could very well be, those who were first.
We started on 17 June. It's very possible that those who were first may have to cut something three times."
