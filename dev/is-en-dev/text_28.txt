Threatened a pedestrian and demanded money
A man was arrested in the town centre after an attempted robbery where he tried to threaten a pedestrian into handing over money.
The man was detained in a holding cell.
The police also received a notification of a man with a knife in the town centre.
The knife was confiscated and a statement taken from the man in question.
The police dealt with approximately eighty matters between 5 PM and 5 AM and six people had been detained in a holding cell this morning.
Police stopped the driver of a vehicle towing a caravan, as the caravan's running gear was in very poor condition.
The caravan was grounded and the owner said he would get a means of transport to move it to town.
The police also stopped drug manufacturing operations in Árbær.
Two were arrested in connection with the case and released after having their statements taken.
There was also a notification of people lighting fireworks in Árbær.
They had fled the scene by the time police arrived "as they probably knew they were not in the right, considering how far off New Year's Eve is."
