Kanye West and his struggle with bipolar disorder
Today, musician Kanye West apologised to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for remarks he made during a manic episode.
The chair of the Icelandic Mental Health Alliance believes the bipolar disorder to be the source of his creativity but a psychiatrist says that it is important for people to take medication to contain the condition.
Rapper Kanye West is not only famous for being one of the most original and influential musicians of our times, but also for being the husband of reality television star Kim Kardashian.
His private life has largely been conducted in public.
His statement earlier this month that he intended to run for President of the United States, and his emotional and incoherent speech on that occasion, was widely reported.
He later posted several bizarre tweets, including claims that his wife was trying to have him committed to a hospital.
Kim Kardashian then posted a statement on Instagram asking people to be understanding towards her husband and the family; he was bipolar and it was difficult for his loved ones to help him if he refused to seek help himself.
He has since offered a public apology to her.
This famous family isn't alone in dealing with this problem.
It's estimated that around one percent of the population experience bipolar disorder.
Ferdinand Jónsson, the senior physician of a mental health team at a London hospital, is very familiar with the condition.
"This condition can create such enormous trouble for the individuals and particularly their families and loved ones.
This mania can destroy relationships and work and cause enormous sorrow.
Then there's the other side, the depression, which is often highly dangerous because there's a high rate of suicides in this group.
So I thought it was beautiful of her to say this.
And that's just human and humane," says Ferdinand.
Héðinn Unnsteinsson, the chair of the Icelandic Mental Health Alliance, has himself dealt with bipolar disorder — and is a fan of Kanye West: "He seems to have a very active imagination.
If we are ordinary four-string double basses, he's a hundred-string celestial harp.
And he's so incredibly creative, incredibly powerful and obviously deep into his powerful connective thinking, because you become aware of this connective thinking that we who have experienced manic episodes know so well."
Kanye West does not want to take antipsychotics as he believes they will reduce his creativity.
He has dealt publicly with his bipolar disorder, including on the album Ye.
Héðinn says that it's his choice not take medication.
"Many feel that it restricts the creative element of this unrestrained connective thinking and enormous fiery creative energy that it has, but there are drawbacks of course; frequent pain and lows, dim cellars and darkness."
However, Ferdinand says that it's important for people with bipolar disorder to receive treatment.
"If you're experiencing enormous mania, you're not producing anything great, you're just totally wild.
And when people enter into a serious depression, the situation completely paralyses them," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medication?
"Absolutely," says Ferdinand.
"And especially to work with someone to find the right dozes and a way to create a balance between the medication helping him to the fullest extent while spoiling as little as possible for him, his talent and his creativity."
