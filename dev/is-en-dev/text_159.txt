Potential group infection underway
Five people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infections this week outside border screenings.
Two of those infected were diagnosed as having a previously unseen variant of the virus, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether these persons were infected by a tourist who has since left the country or an asymptomatic Icelander who is then likely to have infected many more.
The acting Chief Epidemiologist says that a potential group infection may be underway in connection with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 in Iceland last Thursday, each with their own variant of the virus.
The origin of the infections is still unclear.
Three were diagnosed yesterday; one was infected by one of the two diagnosed on Thursday, one came to the country on 15 July and was probably infected overseas, while the third also has an infection with an unclear origin.
A sequence analysis by deCODE Genetics revealed that the two connected persons who were diagnosed with the virus have a new variant that has not been diagnosed before in this country.
Kamilla Jósefsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department and acting Chief Epidemiologist, says that deCODE Genetics is now reviewing the mostly likely origin of this type of the virus.
"One instance was similar to a virus that has been seen in Switzerland although it wasn't exactly the same.
They are going to look into this, try to map it out in more detail and deduce in which part of the world the infection originates," she says.
"It seems to be from this side of the Atlantic, however."
The infections are therefore unrelated to the two infections in early July that were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new type comes from abroad rather than having mutated in this country?
"Yes, it's so unlike what has been found here before that there's really no likelihood of it having been brewing here," answers Kamilla. 
"Instead, everything points to these persons having come into some contact with a person who has just arrived from overseas, without them being aware of it themselves."
When asked, she says that there are still no indications as to from where this new virus could have entered the country.
"It could of course be a tourist who has since left the country, but it could also be someone who is asymptomatic and doesn't realise that they are infected, in which case more infections could obviously follow.
We will be watching this closely over the next few days."
As yet, we don't see anything that is a clear group infection.
But there are persons who went into quarantine in connection with one of the infections yesterday who now have symptoms and have been tested," Kamilla continues.
"We don't have the results yet.
So a group infection is possibly underway."
Do you assume that there are community-acquired infections now?
"It cannot be ruled out.
We have not seen them recently but it cannot be ruled out because we don't know who may have infected the persons who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday," she replies.
Could this be characterised as the start of a new wave of the virus?
"No, not yet.
But we have to be very vigilant, of course, and keep in mind that there are certain limits to how many tests we can do.
We don't test asymptomatic people, but since we are seeing infections that seem to be untraceable we have to have some more freedom as regards testing people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, you can expect Landspítali's bacterial and virology department to increase testing in the coming days in order to better map out the domestic situation.
Has Landspítali Hospital the capacity to increase domestic testing and handle border screening?
"Not unlimited, no.
That is why there has to be some basis for testing persons who are not part of the screening projects; the person in question must be in quarantine and be symptomatic or have had symptoms, and suspect that they have come into contact with someone who has just come to the country, or something like that," says Kamilla.
She notes that the infections diagnosed yesterday are still being traced, and that great efforts are being made to gather information on where these persons have been.
She says that the origin of the domestic infections seems to be untraceable but does not rule out that some of those who have been quarantined may provide clues that could lead the tracing team to the original infections.
