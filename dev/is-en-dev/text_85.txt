Dropped the trophy and smashed it to pieces
Despite Branislav Ivanovic's long experience in lifting trophies and celebrating titles, he dropped and broke a beautiful trophy when celebrating his Russian Cup win yesterday.
Ivanovic won a number of titles as a Chelsea player in 2008–2017 before returning to Russia and joining Zenit.
With them, he has now become Russian champion two years in a row and yesterday, the team won the Russian Cup in a 1-0 victory over Khimki, with Artem Dzyuba scoring the winning penalty in the 84th minute.
The Russian Cup trophy is made of glass so when Zenit captain Ivanovic dropped it to the ground, it broke, as can be seen.
Ivanovic and his team were unfazed and continued partying into the night.
