Real Madrid players exempt from quarantine rules
Zinedine Zidane and his Real Madrid players will be able to go to England for their second Champions League match against Manchester City without having to be quarantined for two weeks.
British authorities have decided that travellers from Spain must be quarantined for two weeks in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
There are exceptions to this, however, such as in the case of teams at the top level of sports.
The Minister of Sports confirmed this to Sky Sports.
According to the Ministry, persons who are exempt from the rules will only stay in special areas behind closed doors.
This is supposed to apply to sports stars, referees, trainers, medical teams and the members of the media.
Thus, the Madridians, who are behind after their 2-1 loss on Santiago Bernebeu on 26 February, are able to face Manchester City on 7 August without having to stay too long in England.
The winning team goes on to the quarter-final, which will take place in Portugal.
