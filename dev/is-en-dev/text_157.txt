"Earned himself" a continued stay in a holding cell
The Reykjavík Metropolitan Police had its hands quite full today.
One of the police's tasks was arresting a man by the police station at Hverfisgata this morning.
The man had been released from a holding cell a short while earlier but refused to leave, came back again and again and did not follow the police's order to leave.
"He earned himself a continued stay with the police," reads the police diary.
Other police tasks included a notification of assault in Breiðholt between 10 and 11 this morning, which required police to get involved with two men.
Police also had to get involved with a woman in a Kópavogur shopping mall who had eaten there but didn't have money to pay the bill.
