Car on fire just outside Borgarnes
Traffic direction was required when a car caught on fire just beyond the golf clubhouse Hamar in Borgarnes shortly before four o'clock.
According to the Borgarnes fire brigade, efforts to put out the fire in the car were successful, and the car is expected to be moved soon.
There were two men in the car when the fire broke out due to a technical malfunction in the car, but both are safe and completely unharmed.
Traffic had to be directed while firefighting work was underway as there is heavy traffic in both directions in the area.
