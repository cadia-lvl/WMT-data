The police will not spread the virus
There is no reason to worry that the coronavirus could spread with the breathalysers used by the police.
This is according to a police officer in the traffic division of the Reykjavík Metropolitan Police, in an interview with mbl.is.
Mbl.is has received comments from people who are worried about the same mouthpiece being used for all drivers when the police positions itself on a busy traffic street and lets all who pass by blow into a breathalyser.
However, the police says that strict hygiene measures are observed.
"In fact, these are not special mouthpieces but breathalysers with a cup for people to blow into," the policeman says.
"Some want to put their lips to it, but we instruct people to keep a little distance, a few tens of centimetres."
When asked if this is considered sufficient distance, the policeman says that he believes so.
If the test turns out to be positive, the police uses another breathalyser.
That one has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
