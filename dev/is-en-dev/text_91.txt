Had a miracle baby at 47
American reality television star Kenya Moore does good deeds by supporting people in need of IVF.
Moore, who is known for her participation in the Real Housewives of Atlanta series, had her first baby at the age of 47, following IVF, and calls her daughter the Miracle Baby.
"I waited almost my whole life to have a baby," said Moore in an interview with People Magazine.
So I know the despair that people, particularly women, feel when they think that they may not be able to have a child."
When Moore turned forty, she realised that she was running out of time.
"I didn't want to have a baby on my own.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after I had turned forty, I looked up and thought "oh, my God,"" says Moore, who nevertheless did not meet the father of her child until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The reality star says that her daughter is a miracle baby in more ways than one.
In addition to Moore being older than most first-time mothers, her daughter was born a month and a half before the due date.
Moore had a caesarean section which turned out to be complicated and take much longer than a standard caesarean section.
"I call her the Miracle Baby because she was a baby that everyone said I had no chance of having," said Moore in the interview.
