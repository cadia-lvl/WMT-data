Waited until the 98th minute in the last game to score the season's first goal
Jesse Lingard hadn't scored a goal or provided an assist in the Premier League this season until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute in the League's final round.
Lingard hadn't scored in the Premier League since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came on as a substitute for Manchester United today in the team's deciding match against Leicester for a place in the Champions League.
After more than seven minutes of injury time, Lingard caught the ball from Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and scored into the empty goal.
A long-awaited goal for Jesse Lingard.
