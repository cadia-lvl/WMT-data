First suspected Coronavirus infection in North Korea
The state news agency of North Korea reported last night that the first COVID-19 infection in the country had probably been diagnosed.
According to the report, the infected person is a man who fled the country three years ago but returned to North Korea last week.
The man was diagnosed in the border city of Kaesong, which has now been isolated and a curfew imposed on its residents.
North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un held an emergency meeting with senior officials to decide how to respond to these concerning news.
According to a State Television report, Kim ordered "maximum security measures" to prevent the spread of the virus.
He also ordered an investigation of how the man could travel undetected across the heavily guarded border between the two Korean states, and warned that those responsible could expect "harsh punishment".
