"No way out of this"
I was greeted warmly at the home of Baltasar and Kristjana Samper in Kópavogur.
The reason for my visit is a new art exhibition by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will open on 1 August in Hlaðan at Litli-Kambur, Snæfellsnes.
This is the first time that father and daughter hold a joint exhibition.
I was led into Baltasar's studio, where I was met with imposing paintings.
Large, gloomy pictures of women of past centuries but also flying creatures; an eagle in one, the shadows of a bird on another.
The studio opens up into the garden of the house.
"We had a horse here who ate the grass," Baltasar tells me.
"The horse works much better than a lawnmower on the mounds and hills that we have here."
Mireaya is with Kristjana, Baltasar and me, and she talks about how her pieces correspond to the pieces here.
"Installations, a mixture of paper pieces and jewellery sculptures.
They are all very white and in contrast to what dad is doing, as I am working with light and so forth," she says.
"This idea came up a year ago.
There were certain pieces that I was working on and would have liked to exhibit there, but they were stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When dad had begun painting and I saw the direction he was going, I reconsidered my part," Mireya says — Baltasar's work contains strong references to Icelandic folk tales about powerful women and supernatural beings.
"When I saw that dad was doing these paintings with the women, I thought it was ideal to make jewellery connected to them," says Mireya. She creates the jewellery in collaboration with goldsmith Sigurður Ingi Bjarnason of the shop Sign.
"Then I create an installation from the jewellery."
Last year, Mireya attended an exhibition by 72 artists from the Academy of the Senses in Snæfellsnes, including at Hlaðan at Litli-Kambur, and found the building captivating. 
"It's a new space, an old barn that was recently renovated," says Mireya. While there, she chatted with art historian Baldvina Sverrisdóttir, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar hold a joint exhibition.
"She wanted us both to exhibit, and then we thought:
"Why not?
It's a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938 and studied at the Barcelona Academy of Art before embarking on a tour around the world to visit art museums and conduct research.
He stopped in Iceland in 1961 and became fascinated with the country and its people.
He came back here a little while later, met his wife, Kristjana, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a prolific artist, having held tens of solo exhibitions and exhibitions with Kristjana in many places.
He is best known for his large murals, including his wall decoration in Flatey Church and his fresco in Víðistaðir Church.
"My influence is the light that can only be found in Iceland and no other place," says Baltasar.
"The low sun and the shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I came here, I thought: "Wow, you can work here.""
Mireya is the oldest of Kristjana and Baltasar's children, born in 1964.
"There was one thing I knew very clearly: that I was not going to be an artist," she says when asked whether she wanted to follow the example of her parents.
"So I attended the math and natural sciences department at grammar school and did everything I could to get away from this.
Then I realised that I was on the run.
The only thing to do is to give up," says Mireya with a laugh.
She has, like her father, exhibited her work around the world.
Frequently in Japan, for example.
All of Baltasar and Kristjana's children have had a career in the arts.
"I call it a virus," says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
