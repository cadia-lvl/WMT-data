"Paranoid" ambassador wants gun, armoured car and stab-proof vest - called subordinates agents of the "Deep State"
According to a CBS News report today, the politically appointed US Ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, wants to carry a firearm.
The opening words of the CBS report read: "Despite being assigned to one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been "paranoid" about his security since coming to Reykjavik last year."
CBS's sources are 12 diplomats, government officials and former officials, as well as individuals familiar with the situation.
Gunter's conclusion was to demand that the US State Department obtain permission for the paranoid ambassador to carry arms in Iceland.
He is also said to have requested an armoured car to transport him from one place to another in Iceland, and a stab-proof vest.
The US State Department declined to say if there is any threat to the ambassador's safety, although US government officials said that the ambassador had been informed that Iceland is a safe country and that he is safe.
Despite this, jobs listings for bodyguards were placed in Icelandic newspapers, according to CBS, which was part of meeting the ambassador's demands.
According to CBS's report, the Iceland Ministry for Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the matter to CBS.
However, the American news agency quoted its Icelandic sources as saying that no such request had been received by Icelandic authorities.
CBS adds that Gunter had been talked out of walking around armed because it would offend the host nation, Iceland.
The ambassador received his position as a reward for his generous contributions to Donald Trump's campaign fund in the 2016 presidential election.
Before that, he was a dermatologist in California.
Since taking over in May, Gunter is said to have created an "untenable" working environment, having already gone trough seven immediate subordinates, so-called Deputy Chiefs of Mission, who are the ambassador's second in command as well as being posted diplomats.
These were all experienced diplomats from the US State Department.
The ambassador sent the first one away because he "didn't like the look of him".
He had already prepared for a whole year and learnt Icelandic.
The second lasted only six months.
A staff rotation system was subsequently set up, with the idea of Gunter trying out as many people as possible until he found someone he liked.
CBS furthermore claims that Gunter accused embassy staff of acting on behalf of the "Deep State" and undermining his relationship with the State Department in Washington DC.
State Department leadership in Washington is said to be well aware of the situation in their Reykjavík embassy, but be reluctant to take charge of the chaos at the embassy in light of Gunter's connections to the White House.
Gunter is also said to have had difficulty following orders from the State Department in Washington, and to have refused to return to DC while the Covid-19 pandemic was raging.
He left the embassy in the charge of his staff for many months.
He is said to have intended to work remotely from his home in California unless ordered to return by the State Minister himself, Mike Pompeo.
Finally came back
Having finally received the order, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new Deputy Chief of Mission, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their enquiries to the US State Department.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs did not want to offer any comments to CBS, nor to DV's enquiry.
Gunter is one of many of the Trump administration's politically appointed ambassadors to be noted for their unusual behaviour in recent months.
Woody Johnson was harshly criticised, for example, when it was revealed that he had attempted to get the British Open moved to a Trump-owned golf course.
The ambassador to South Africa has also been criticised for dismissing her Deputy Chief of Mission and then trying to appoint her son to the post.
42% of US ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed under Obama's government and 32% under George W. Bush's government.
