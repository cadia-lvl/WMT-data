Followed an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
"I had a crush on her, one of those youthful crushes that you have," says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, lead actress of the series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so captivated by the actress that she showed up at the shooting location for the series and waited for her for hours, just to be able to say "hi".
When Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir, owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, watched, like so many Icelanders, the thriller series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit in the early 2000s, she fell completely for the lead actress, Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her encounter with the actress in the programme Love Stories on Rás 1.
When Birna herself was a teenager, at the age when many people begin to develop raging crushes, she did not have the same experience as her peers because she was busy suppressing her own feelings.
She pretended to be interested in boy bands and young, cool-looking movie heartthrobs, but wasn't interested at all.
"I was cutting out pictures from pop magazines and hanging pictures of the Backstreet Boys and Jared Leto on the wall.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding the fact that I was a lesbian."
She says that people who come out of the closet are often said to experience delayed puberty.
"We spend our teenage years suppressing these teenage urges, these crushes and so on.
I think that this was one of the things that attracted me to her," says Birna about the actress.
"And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I just had a crush on her."
The actress got lucky when she was in New York a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erlingur Óttar Thoroddsen, was shooting a film in the city and recruited Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helgi Guðjónsson, to assist with the shoot.
"We were working as part of a crew of 30 and spent quite a bit of time with strangers.
Of course, spending such a long time together each day creates an intimate atmosphere, so we talked about everything and nothing."
One day, the talk turned to how much of a fan of Mariska Birna is.
One woman on the crew said that her friend was acquainted with the actress because he was part of the show's crew.
Birna could not stop thinking about this fact and asked her new friend regularly how her friend liked working with the actress and whether Birna could meet her.
"She told me to stop, that she had no idea whether she could make this happen," says Birna.
When the film shoot was finally over, the crew celebrated and Birna made a final attempt to convince the woman to try to arrange the meeting.
"She had had a few drinks and said that she would take care of it."
A few days later, Birna sent the woman a message to ask whether something was happening in this matter.
The woman didn't respond, at which point Birna decided to give up.
But one morning she awoke to a long-awaited message.
"I looked at the phone and screamed.
The screams woke Gunnar Helgi up, and I said: I have to take a shower, make myself pretty and go downtown."
The woman had written to Birna to say that her friend and the cast and crew of Law and Order were at a hotel in Times Square.
"I don't know when they start or when they stop but this is the name of the hotel, good luck," read the message. Birna got dressed in a hurry. She asked the reception were the shoot was taking place, and took the lift up to the 45th floor, where the group was gathered.
Birna found a spot and waited until a woman in the crew came to her and asked this woman who no one had invited, if she could help her with anything.
"I said that I was looking for Jason, and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived."
When the friend finally came, he looked at Birna in amazement and asked how on earth she managed to reach the set, as there was supposed to be heavy security.
Birna explained that she had just taken the lift, and asked to meet Mariska.
"Well, I don't know.
Sit here," said the friend and Birna sat down.
An extra from the series sat beside her, and they began to chat.
"I said to him: I'm a fan, what about you?" says Birna.
"I acted like this was the most normal thing in the world."
Time passed and Birna waited.
The actors came out regularly during breaks in shooting to have snacks, and Birna looked around in search of Mariska, who was nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend came and told her that unfortunately he was leaving.
Birna asked him to pass her on to another crew member, as she had no intention of going anywhere yet.
Surprised, the friend agreed and fetched another crew member.
„He brought another friend of his and said: This is the woman from Iceland who's dying to meet Mariska."
Then he left.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend came running to Birna.
"He said: Hurry.
The circumstances today are unusual. There are reporters with her, so she won't stop.
She'll go directly to the car with them so you'll have to take the chance and go down to find her trailer.
It's white and is marked.
Hurry up."
"Then I looked to the right and was astounded" Birna rushed to take the lift down to Times Square.
There she found around forty trailers, some marked and some not.
She didn't find Mariska's trailer anywhere, however, and she began to feel desperate.
"I found the sense of defeat come over me because I had spent half a day on this, but then I thought oh well, I tried.
This was fun."
Feeling disheartened, Birna began walking back to the hotel, where she saw the crew look at her through the window with pity in their eyes, as it was clear that Birna had not succeeded at what she had set out to do.
Birna accepted her fate and it began to rain.
"I went under a shelter to protect myself from the rain.
Then I looked to the right and was astounded."
None other than Mariska Hargitay was standing there in the trouser suit that she wears on the show and Birna knows quite well — but Birna was so emotional that she could hardly move.
"I looked at my body and arms and thought, now you have to move.
Now you have to go over to her."
Birna did so, and gathered the courage to poke the actress's shoulder.
"She looked at me and I could barely say anything.
But I just greeted her and said hello," Birna recalls.
"I said that I was from Iceland and was a big fan.
She said: How nice to meet you."
The conversation wasn't much longer, as Mariska's car had arrived and the horn honked for her.
Mariska turned to Birna and said: "I have to go but it was incredibly nice to meet you."
Birna said goodbye to her idol, watched the car drive away and then collapsed.
"I was weeping when I called Erlingur and Gunni, and they thought that this hadn't worked.
But I was crying because of the release of pent-up tension and the joy.
I said: Yes, I met her. You have to meet me now.
Then we celebrated with club soda and tequila," says Birna.
She has no regrets, although she admits that she would probably not do this again.
"This is a once in a lifetime thing, to sacrifice time and energy to make something like this happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
