Prince Joachim said to be in a stable condition
Prince Joachim, the younger son of Margrethe Þórhildur, Queen of Denmark, and the late Prince Henrik of Denmark, is still in hospital in Toulouse, France, where he underwent surgery on a blood clot in his brain the day before yesterday.
DR, the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, quoted a spokesman of the Danish court as saying that it was unclear how long the prince, who is 51, will remain in the hospital, but that his condition was stable.
According to DR's report, tests are now being conducted to determine the effects of the blood clot on the prince's health.
According to DR's health correspondent, physician Peter Qvortrup Geisling, the effects of a blood clot in the brain often do not become apparent until days after the operation.
According to Geisling, "they can include anything from negligible symptoms to hemiplegia, memory problems or difficulty expressing oneself."
He says that the prince may have to go through many months of rehabilitation.
Prince Joachim, whose full name is Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and who is also Count of Monpezat, was staying at the family vineyard, Château de Cayx in the South of France when he fell ill on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in the nearby town of Cahors before being transferred to the Tolouse University Hospital where he underwent surgery on a blood clot in his brain.
